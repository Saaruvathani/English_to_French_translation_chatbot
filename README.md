# English to French Translator Chatbot

An interactive chatbot that translates English text into French using Hugging Face’s pre-trained NLP models. The chatbot provides accurate translations along with a dynamic typing effect for a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using a pre-trained machine translation model. The chatbot accepts English input, processes it through a Hugging Face translation pipeline, and displays the French translation in real time. A typing animation is used to simulate natural response flow.
